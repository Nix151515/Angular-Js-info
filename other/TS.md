TS - validate JS ahead of time with static type checking

Generics, <>, are useful when we can expect different types (number now, string next time).
TS will identify based on the values we provide and bind to that type in that case.



any, unknown, never
any = no type checks
unknown = there is a type that we don't know and we have to do type checks to fit it
never = a type assigned when there is no possible type for that entity - any other type will be faulty logic.
